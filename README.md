# Shop exercise

Here you should practise how to structure your application.


## Tasks

1. Define, which class goes into which layer (view, domain,
   infrastructure). Create a new folder for each layer and move the classes into their folders.

2. Add the missing require statements.

3. All method bodies in `shop_manager.rb` are currently empty. Implement all method bodies. You only need the `@shopping_card` and `@database` variables. Also you need to use the `Article` class.

4. Complete the `menu.rb` class so that in the end you can order articles, show all available articles, show shopping card and so on.
